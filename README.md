In this project, the machine learning techniques are used to classify exoplanets based on the given data. The main goal is to identify and distinguish the various types of exoplanets, such as confirmed, candidate, or false positive.
The Libraries used are:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
sklearn: For machine learning and model evaluation.
The code utilizes the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method. The classifier consists of a set of decision trees, which can improve the prediction accuracy.
